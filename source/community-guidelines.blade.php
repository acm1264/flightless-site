    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Flightless Blog. The Flightless team is doing our best to ensure discussions in the comments of our articles
    are free from spam, abuse, and trolling, but we can't be present at all times. We like to encourage everyone to engage
    with our blog posts through providing reactions and having discussions in the comments. To help everyone to have a good time
    in our blogs, please make sure to follow our guidelines:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Be polite – Do not be rude or disrespectful to others. While civil arguments and disagreements are welcome, 
    please do not get ugly. If you would get in trouble for saying something in person, do not say it online.</li>
    <li>Don’t troll. We encourage you to share any constructive criticisms you have with the articles, but comments that either 
    add no value to the discussions or are simply insulting will be deleted.</li>
    <li>No Spam. Unless we are discussing canned meats, spam will not be allowed in any capacity and will be removed.</li>
    <li> No NSFW content or controversial topics, such as politics, religion, or sexual beliefs, as these topics often lead to conflicts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>TLDR: Be respectful and on-topic in the comments. If you violate any of these guidelines, our moderators will remove your comment and, if needed
    for repeat offenders, ban you from posting in our comments.</p>
    <p>Please "flag" or "mark as spam" any comments you see violating these guidelines.</p>
    <p>Thank you for the support and have fun chatting!</p>
